# PayNetHackathon

## Overview

This project is part of the **PayNet Hackathon**, focusing on **Personal Financial Management (PFM)**.

### Hackathon Challenge
**How can we use access to CASA (current & savings accounts), term deposits, credit cards, loans, and transaction data across banks to create more data-driven financial solutions tailored to customer needs?**

Our solution is designed to tackle this challenge by leveraging modern technologies to provide innovative, user-centric financial tools.
