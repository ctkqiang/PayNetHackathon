## Debt Service Ratio (DSR)

### **Definition:**

The **Debt Service Ratio (DSR)** is a key financial metric that indicates how much of a person’s or entity’s income is used to cover debt payments. It’s a measure of an individual's ability to meet debt obligations without overburdening their finances.

### **Formula:**

$$
DSR = \frac{{\text{Total Debt Payments}}}{{\text{Monthly Income}}}
$$

Where:

- **Total Debt Payments**: The sum of all monthly debt payments, including loans, mortgages, credit cards, and other obligations.
- **Monthly Income**: The individual’s or business’s gross monthly income.

### **Interpretation:**

- **DSR < 30%**: Healthy, low risk, strong financial position (Good)
- **30% - 40%**: Manageable, generally acceptable (Neutral/Acceptable)
- **> 40%**: Higher debt load, increased financial strain (Risky/Bad)
- **> 50%**: Financially overburdened, high risk (Very Bad)

**How to Use:**
A lower DSR indicates that a person or business has more disposable income after debt payments, making it easier to save or invest. A higher DSR may signal financial distress, making it harder to meet financial obligations.

## Wealth Accumulation Ratio (WAR)

### **Definition:**

The **Wealth Accumulation Ratio (WAR)** measures how effectively an individual or entity is accumulating wealth in relation to their income. A higher WAR suggests greater financial stability and growth potential.

### **Formula:**

$$
WAR = \frac{{\text{Net Worth}}}{{\text{Annual Income}}}
$$

Where:

- **Net Worth**: The total value of assets (cash, investments, property) minus liabilities (debts, loans, etc.).
- **Annual Income**: The individual’s or business's annual income, including salary, investment income, or other earnings.

### **Interpretation:**

- **WAR < 1**: The individual or business has accumulated less wealth than their income, potentially living paycheck to paycheck or accruing debt.
- **WAR = 1**: The individual or business has accumulated an amount of wealth equal to their income, typical for someone just starting to accumulate assets.
- **WAR > 1**: The individual or business has accumulated more wealth than their annual income, indicating strong financial health.
- **WAR >> 1**: Very strong wealth accumulation, with wealth growing significantly faster than income.

**How to Use:**
A higher WAR indicates better financial growth, meaning the individual or business has accumulated wealth faster than their income growth. This is often seen in those with significant investments, savings, or business ventures.

## Net Worth

### **Definition:**

Net worth is a financial metric that shows the total value of assets owned by an individual or entity after subtracting liabilities. It’s a snapshot of an individual’s overall financial position.

### **Formula:**

$$
\text{Net Worth} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities}
$$


Where:

- **Total Assets**: The sum of all valuable assets, including cash, properties, investments, etc.
- **Total Liabilities**: The sum of all debts and obligations, including loans, mortgages, and credit card balances.

### **Interpretation:**

- **Positive Net Worth**: Indicates the individual or business has more assets than liabilities, a sign of financial health.
- **Negative Net Worth**: Indicates the individual or business owes more than they own, which could be a sign of financial distress.

**How to Use:**
Net worth is a fundamental indicator of financial health. A higher net worth generally means better financial security, while a negative net worth indicates significant financial struggles.

## Cash Flow

### **Definition:**

Cash flow refers to the total amount of money coming in and going out of an individual’s or business’s accounts over a specific period. It measures liquidity and is essential for understanding the ability to meet short-term obligations.

### **Formula:**

$$
\text{Cash Flow} = \text{Total Cash Inflows} - \text{Total Cash Outflows}
$$


Where:

- **Cash Inflows**: All money received, such as income, business revenues, and investment returns.
- **Cash Outflows**: All money spent, including living expenses, loan payments, and other financial obligations.

### **Interpretation:**

- **Positive Cash Flow**: Indicates that more money is coming in than going out, allowing the individual or business to save, invest, or pay off debt.
- **Negative Cash Flow**: Indicates that more money is going out than coming in, which can lead to liquidity problems or debt accumulation.

**How to Use:**
Positive cash flow is vital for long-term financial stability. Negative cash flow should be addressed by increasing income, reducing expenses, or restructuring debt.

## How to Use These Metrics

1. **Assess Financial Health**: These metrics can be used together to give a complete picture of an individual’s or business’s financial status. For example, high DSR with low net worth might indicate poor financial health.

2. **Monitor Over Time**: Track changes in these metrics to assess the effectiveness of financial strategies, such as reducing debt, increasing savings, or improving cash flow.

3. **Risk Management**: Use these metrics to assess the financial risk of individuals, businesses, or investments. High DSR, negative net worth, or negative cash flow all indicate increased financial risk.

4. **Financial Planning**: These metrics are crucial in setting realistic financial goals. A healthy DSR, high WAR, positive cash flow, and growing net worth are indicators of financial success.
